# Mean-Corpuscular-Volume
Here's a complete Python code that calculates the Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) based on user input
In this code, the calculate_mcv() function accepts two parameters: red_blood_cells and hematocrit. It calculates the MCV using the formula (hematocrit / red_blood_cells) * 10 and returns the result.

The user is prompted to enter the number of red blood cells (red_blood_cells) and the hematocrit value (hematocrit). The values are then passed to the calculate_mcv() function to calculate the MCV. Finally, the calculated MCV is displayed with two decimal places using the print() function.

Please note that this code assumes the values entered by the user are valid and there is no error handling for invalid inputs.
