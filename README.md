## Introduction
Welcome to the Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) Calculator! This Python program allows you to calculate the MCV, which is a measure of the average volume of red blood cells in a given blood sample. The MCV value can provide valuable information about various medical conditions and is commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of anemia.

## Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
The Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is a measurement that represents the average size of red blood cells in a blood sample. It is typically reported in femtoliters (fL). The MCV value can help healthcare professionals diagnose and classify different types of anemia. 

Anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells or a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. By measuring the MCV, healthcare professionals can determine whether the anemia is due to smaller-than-normal red blood cells (microcyticemia), larger-than-normal red blood cells (macrocytic anemia), or normal-sized red blood cells (normocytic anemia).

## Installation
To use the MCV Calculator, follow these steps1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-usernamepo-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repo-name`

## Usage
1. Open the `calculate_mcv.py` file in a Python IDE or text editor.
2. Run the script3. Enter the number red blood cells (red_blood_cells) when prompted.
4. Enter the hematocrit value (hematocrit) when prompted.
5. The program will calculate the MCV using the formula `(hematocrit / red_blood_cells) * 10`.
6. The calculated MCV will be displayed with two decimal places.

Example:
```
Enter the number of red blood cells: 4.5
Enter the hematocrit value: 42
The Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is: 9.33 fL
```
